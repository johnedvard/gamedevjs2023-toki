Toky only plays well in Chrome, not Safari.

### NEAR

NEAR should work on [Itch.io](https://johnonym.itch.io/toki), where the game jam competition is hosted, but if it doesn't, use these URLs instead to play the game and test the NEAR NFT integration.

[Mainnet](https://gamedevjs2023-toki.netlify.app/)
[Testnet](https://gamedevjs2023-toki-testnet.netlify.app/)

It's possible to buy NFTs from the store (after completing the tutorial level.) These NFTs are also listed on [Paras's Markeplace](https://paras.id/), which means you can transfer or sell the NFTs to others.

## Get started

```
npm install
npm run start
```
